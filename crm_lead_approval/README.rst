This module enables an approval process for opportunities in the CRM.
Approvals can be configured according to Sales Teams or CRM Tags and
then matching opportunities can be submitted to the approval process
through a dedicated button.

Configuration
=============

1. Navigate to the CRM settings.
2. Add the relevant Sales Teams and/or CRM Tags to the "Sales Teams
   opportunities approval" and "CRM Tags opportunities approval"
   settings.

Once configured, the approval button will appear in leads, allowing them
to enter the approval process, but only for opportunities associated
with the specified Sales Teams or CRM Tags.

Usage
=====

1. Access your leads in the CRM:

- Go to *CRM > Sales > My Pipeline*.
- Open an existing lead or create a new one.

2. Provide an opinion on the lead:

- Locate the approval button "Approve/Refuse" on the left side of the
  screen (visible only if you have the necessary permissions).
- Click the button, and an approval popup will appear.
- Optionally, add a comment to justify your opinion.
- Click one of the following buttons to confirm and submit your opinion:
  "Approve", "Reserved", or "Disapprove".

3. Message added to the lead's chatter:

- Once the opinion is submitted, a message will automatically be added
  to the lead's chatter, recording the opinion and any accompanying
  comment.
